## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Connection Refused Error**
   - Ensure the proxy service is running on port 3001
   - Check that no other service is using port 3001
   - Verify firewall settings

2. **Authentication Error**
   - Confirm that the PROXY_AUTH_KEY in `.env` matches the proxyAuthKey in the HTML file
   - Ensure the Wardah API key is valid and has necessary permissions

3. **Data Not Loading**
   - Verify that your Wardah ERP instance is accessible
   - Check the proxy service logs for error messages
   - Ensure the Wardah API key has the correct permissions

## Production Considerations

For production deployment, consider the following:

1. **Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Store API keys securely (not in version control)
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization

2. **Performance**
   - Use a process manager like PM2 for the proxy service
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Monitor service performance and resource usage

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up logging for the proxy service
   - Implement error tracking and alerting
   - Monitor API usage and rate limits
