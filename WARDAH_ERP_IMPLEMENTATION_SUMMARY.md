# Wardah ERP Implementation Summary

## üéØ Project Overview

We have successfully implemented the Wardah ERP handover package, creating a comprehensive enterprise manufacturing system with advanced process costing capabilities. This implementation transforms the existing frontend application into a full-featured ERP solution with a robust backend database structure.

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Highlights

### 1. Database Schema Implementation
- **Core Tables**: Organizations, users, chart of accounts, GL mappings
- **Manufacturing Tables**: Products, BOMs, manufacturing orders, work centers, labor entries, overhead rates/allocation
- **Inventory & Costing**: Stock quants, stock moves, cost settings with AVCO integration
- **Sales & Purchasing**: Vendors, customers, purchase orders, sales orders
- **Performance Optimization**: Indexes for all critical tables
- **Data Integrity**: Constraints to ensure data consistency

### 2. Security Implementation
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Multi-tenant data isolation
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin, manager, and user roles
- **Organization Access Management**: User-organization relationships
- **Helper Functions**: Auth functions for role checking
- **Performance Indexes**: Optimized RLS policy execution

### 3. Advanced Costing Functions
- **AVCO Inventory Management**: Automatic average cost calculation
- **Manufacturing Order Processing**: Complete MO lifecycle management
- **Material Issuance**: Automated material issue to WIP
- **Labor Tracking**: Direct labor time recording and costing
- **Overhead Application**: Flexible overhead allocation methods
- **MO Completion**: Automatic FG receipt with calculated unit costs

### 4. Reporting & Analytics
- **Inventory Valuation**: Real-time inventory valuation reports
- **WIP Analysis**: Work-in-progress cost tracking
- **Variance Analysis**: Overhead variance calculation
- **Cost Breakdown**: Detailed cost component analysis

### 5. Data Import Capabilities
- **Chart of Accounts Import**: Automated COA data import from CSV
- **GL Mappings Import**: Event-based accounting mappings
- **JSON Conversion**: Scripts to convert CSV to JSON format

## üß™ Testing Framework

We've implemented a comprehensive testing framework that demonstrates:

1. **Full Transaction Flow**: From material receipt to finished goods production
2. **Costing Accuracy**: Verified AVCO calculations and overhead application
3. **Security Testing**: RLS policy validation with different user roles
4. **Reporting Validation**: All reporting functions working correctly
5. **Data Integrity**: Constraints preventing invalid data entry
