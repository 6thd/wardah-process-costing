# Account Analysis Scripts

This document explains the account analysis scripts created to provide detailed information about your gl_accounts hierarchy.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. DETAILED_ACCOUNT_ANALYSIS.sql
A comprehensive analysis script that provides:
- Basic statistics about accounts
- Identification of invalid parent references
- Detection of circular references
- Account distribution by category
- Depth analysis (if path column exists)
- Parent-child relationships
- Accounts with the most children
- Duplicate code detection
- Leaf node identification
- Organization distribution

### 2. SIMPLE_ACCOUNT_ANALYSIS.sql
A simplified version that provides the same analysis without the conditional depth analysis, making it compatible with more environments.

## Usage Instructions

1. Run `SIMPLE_ACCOUNT_ANALYSIS.sql` first as it's more compatible with different environments
2. If you want the depth analysis and your table has a path column, try running `DETAILED_ACCOUNT_ANALYSIS.sql`
3. Review the results to understand your current account structure

## Expected Results

The analysis will show you:
- Total account count (you mentioned seeing 10 rows, which matches your current record count)
- How many are root accounts vs. child accounts
- Whether there are any data consistency issues
- The distribution of accounts by category
- Parent-child relationships
- Which accounts have the most children
- Any duplicate codes
- Leaf nodes (accounts with no children)
- Organization distribution

## Interpreting the Results

Based on your previous findings:
- 0 empty parent codes is good - it means data consistency is maintained
- 10 rows matches your current gl_accounts record count
- The increase from 7 to 10 accounts shows improvement after fixing the recursive trigger issue

## Next Steps

1. Review the analysis results to understand your current account structure
2. If you see any issues (invalid parents, circular references, duplicates), use the cleanup script
3. Continue monitoring the account count as you import more data
4. If the account count is still lower than expected (e.g., 190), you may need additional import steps or data source review
