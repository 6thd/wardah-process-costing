# Complete Clean Start Solution for GL Accounts

## Problem

The application was experiencing "stack depth limit exceeded" errors due to recursive triggers, functions, and RLS policies that were creating infinite loops during database operations.

## Solution

This complete clean start solution removes all problematic database objects and creates a new, simple table structure for GL accounts without any triggers, complex constraints, or recursion-prone features.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Apply the Clean Start Script

1. Open your Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy and run the contents of `COMPLETE_CLEAN_START.sql`
3. This will:
   - Remove all problematic triggers and functions
   - Create a backup of your existing data
   - Create a new clean table structure
   - Insert sample data for testing
   - Disable RLS to prevent recursion issues

### 2. Verify the Solution

After running the script, verify that the clean start was successful:

```sql
-- Check that you have 10 sample accounts
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gl_accounts;

-- Check the sample data
SELECT code, name, category FROM gl_accounts ORDER BY code;
```

You should see output like:
```
count
-------
10

code | name              | category
-----|-------------------|----------
1000 | Assets            | ASSET
1100 | Current Assets    | ASSET
1101 | Cash              | ASSET
...
```

### 3. Test with REST API

Test the REST API endpoint to ensure it works without errors:

```javascript
fetch('https://rytzljjlthouptdqeuxh.supabase.co/rest/v1/gl_accounts?select=id,code,name&limit=10', {
  headers: {
    'apikey': 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY'
  }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => console.log('✅ Success:', data))
.catch(err => console.error('❌ Failed:', err));
```

### 4. Test the Application

1. Restart your development server
2. Navigate to the Chart of Accounts page
3. You should now see the sample data without any errors

## What This Solution Does

### 1. Complete Cleanup
- Drops all triggers that were causing recursion
- Removes all functions that could cause recursion
- Cleans up additional columns that were added
- Backs up existing data before making changes

### 2. New Simple Structure
- Creates a clean `gl_accounts` table with a simple structure
- Uses `parent_code` as a simple VARCHAR (not a foreign key)
- Removes complex constraints that could cause issues
- Adds only essential indexes for performance

### 3. Sample Data
- Inserts 10 sample accounts for immediate testing
- All accounts are associated with the default organization
- Covers all major account categories

### 4. Safety Measures
- Disables RLS completely to prevent recursion issues
- Uses a simple table structure that avoids triggers
- Maintains essential functionality while removing complexity

## Benefits

1. **Complete Resolution**: Removes all sources of recursion
2. **Immediate Fix**: Works immediately after applying the script
3. **Safe**: Backs up existing data before making changes
4. **Simple**: Uses a straightforward table structure
5. **Testable**: Includes sample data for immediate verification

## Next Steps

After confirming that the clean start solution works:

1. **Gradually Re-enable Features**: 
   - Add back RLS policies one by one
   - Implement simple triggers if needed
   - Add constraints carefully to avoid recursion

2. **Migrate Real Data**:
   - Use the `gl_accounts_backup` table to migrate your real data
   - Be careful not to reintroduce recursion

3. **Implement Path-Based Hierarchy** (Optional):
   - If you need hierarchical queries, implement a path-based approach
   - Use the ltree extension with proper guards
   - Avoid recursive triggers and CTEs

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Avoid Recursive Triggers**: Never create triggers that can fire themselves
2. **Simplify RLS Policies**: Keep Row Level Security policies simple
3. **Use Path-Based Hierarchy**: For hierarchical data, use path-based approaches
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test database changes with realistic data volumes
5. **Monitor Performance**: Regularly check for query performance issues
