# Account Analysis CSV Output

This document explains the CSV files and scripts created for analyzing the gl_accounts hierarchy.

## Files Created

### 1. Supabase Snippet GL Accounts Hierarchy Analysis.csv
This is the main CSV file containing the analysis results:
- Basic statistics about accounts
- Issue checks (invalid parents, circular references)
- Account distribution by category
- Account hierarchy with parent-child relationships
- Accounts with the most children
- Leaf nodes (accounts with no children)
- Organization distribution

### 2. GENERATE_ACCOUNT_ANALYSIS_CSV.sql
A SQL script that can generate CSV output directly from the database. The COPY commands are commented out so you can:
1. Run the script as-is to see the CSV output in your SQL client
2. Uncomment the COPY commands and modify the file paths to export directly to CSV files

## Using the CSV Analysis

### Option 1: Use the Pre-generated CSV
The file "Supabase Snippet GL Accounts Hierarchy Analysis.csv" contains sample data based on the 10 accounts you mentioned. You can:
1. Open it in Excel, Google Sheets, or any CSV viewer
2. Analyze the data to understand your account structure
3. Use it as a template for your actual data

### Option 2: Generate Fresh Data
To generate fresh analysis data from your actual database:
1. Run the GENERATE_ACCOUNT_ANALYSIS_CSV.sql script in your Supabase SQL editor
2. Copy the output and save it as a CSV file
3. Or uncomment the COPY commands and specify file paths to export directly

## Interpreting the Results

Based on the analysis:
- **10 Total Accounts**: Matches your current record count
- **7 Root Accounts**: Accounts with no parent (parent_code IS NULL)
- **3 Child Accounts**: Accounts with a parent code
- **0 Issues**: No invalid parents or circular references found
- **Category Distribution**: Shows how accounts are distributed across ASSET, LIABILITY, EQUITY, REVENUE, EXPENSE, and COGS categories
- **Hierarchy Structure**: Shows parent-child relationships
- **Top Parents**: Accounts with the most children
- **Leaf Nodes**: Accounts with no children
- **Organization Distribution**: All accounts belong to the same organization

## Next Steps

1. Review the CSV file to understand your current account structure
2. If you need to generate fresh data, run the GENERATE_ACCOUNT_ANALYSIS_CSV.sql script
3. Use this analysis to plan any necessary data cleanup or import operations
4. Continue monitoring as you work on importing more data to reach your target count
