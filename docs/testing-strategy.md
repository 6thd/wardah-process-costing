# Wardah ERP - Process Costing Testing Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Wardah ERP Process Costing system, covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing scenarios.

## Testing Framework Setup

### Unit Testing (Vitest)
- **Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Configuration**: `vitest.config.ts`
- **Setup**: `src/test/setup.ts`
- **Coverage**: V8 provider with HTML reports

### E2E Testing (Playwright)
- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Configuration**: `playwright.config.ts` (to be created)
- **Test Files**: `e2e/*.spec.ts`

## Test Structure

### 1. Domain Logic Tests (`src/domain/__tests__/`)
- **processCosting.test.js**: Core process costing calculations
- **manufacturing.test.js**: Manufacturing order management
- **inventory.test.js**: AVCO inventory valuation
- **audit.test.js**: Audit trail logging

### 2. Component Tests (`src/features/**/__tests__/`)
- **stage-costing-panel.test.tsx**: Stage costing UI component
- **manufacturing-orders.test.tsx**: MO management interface
- **inventory-movements.test.tsx**: Stock movement tracking

### 3. Integration Tests (`src/integration/__tests__/`)
- **process-costing-workflow.test.ts**: End-to-end process flow
- **multi-tenant-security.test.ts**: RLS and JWT testing
- **database-transactions.test.ts**: Atomic operations

### 4. E2E Tests (`e2e/`)
- **process-costing.spec.ts**: Complete user workflows
- **multi-stage-processing.spec.ts**: Multi-stage cost flows
- **reporting-integration.spec.ts**: Report generation

## Test Coverage Areas

### Core Process Costing Formula
```
Total Cost = Transferred In + Direct Materials + Direct Labor + MOH - Waste Credit
Unit Cost = Total Cost / Good Quantity
Efficiency = Good Quantity / (Good + Scrap + Rework) × 100%
```

### AVCO Methodology
```
Average Cost = Total Cost of Inventory / Total Quantity
New Average = (Previous Total Cost + New Cost) / (Previous Qty + New Qty)
```

### Multi-Stage Cost Flow
- Stage 1: Raw materials processing
- Stage 2: Assembly with transferred-in costs
- Stage 3: Finishing with cumulative costs
- Final: Completed goods valuation

## Key Test Scenarios

### 1. Stage Costing Calculations
- ✅ Basic stage cost calculation using standard formula
- ✅ Multi-stage cost flow with transferred-in costs
- ✅ AVCO inventory valuation
- ✅ Scrap and rework quantity handling
- ✅ Efficiency calculation validation

### 2. Labor Time Application
- ✅ Direct labor cost calculation
- ✅ Multiple employees and shifts
- ✅ Overtime and premium rates
- ✅ Labor efficiency variance

### 3. Manufacturing Overhead
- ✅ Overhead application based on labor cost
- ✅ Machine hours allocation base
- ✅ Variable vs fixed overhead
- ✅ Overhead variance analysis

### 4. Integration Testing
- ✅ Database transaction integrity
- ✅ Multi-tenant security (RLS)
- ✅ Audit trail generation
- ✅ Real-time data synchronization

### 5. User Interface Testing
- ✅ Form validation and error handling
- ✅ Action-based event system
- ✅ Results display and formatting
- ✅ Responsive design and accessibility

### 6. End-to-End Workflows
- ✅ Complete process costing workflow
- ✅ Multi-stage manufacturing process
- ✅ Integration with inventory and GL
- ✅ Report generation and export

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing Scenarios
1. **Concurrent Stage Calculations**: 50+ users calculating costs simultaneously
2. **Large Dataset Processing**: 10,000+ manufacturing orders
3. **Real-time Updates**: Live cost updates across multiple stages
4. **Report Generation**: Complex multi-stage cost reports

### Performance Benchmarks
- Stage calculation: < 500ms
- GL posting: < 1000ms
- Report generation: < 3000ms
- Database queries: < 100ms average

## Security Testing

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enforcement
- ✅ JWT token validation
- ✅ Tenant data isolation
- ✅ Cross-tenant access prevention

### Data Integrity
- ✅ Atomic transaction handling
- ✅ Concurrent update protection
- ✅ Audit trail completeness
- ✅ Cost calculation accuracy

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch        # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage     # With coverage report
npm run test:ui           # Visual test runner
```

### E2E Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e          # Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:headed   # With browser UI
npm run test:e2e:debug    # Debug mode
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
npm run test:ci           # Full test suite for CI
npm run test:smoke        # Quick smoke tests
npm run test:regression   # Regression test suite
```

## Test Data Management
