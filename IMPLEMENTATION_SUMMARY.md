# Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all the files created and updated to implement the enhanced accounting integration for the process costing system.

## Files Created

### Services
1. `src/services/accounting/posting-service.ts` - Service for GL posting operations
2. `src/services/accounting/variance-monitoring-service.ts` - Service for variance analysis and monitoring
3. `src/services/accounting/notification-service.ts` - Service for user notifications
4. `src/services/accounting/README.md` - Documentation for accounting services

### Jobs
5. `src/jobs/variance-monitoring-job.ts` - Scheduled job for variance monitoring

### SQL Scripts
6. `sql/15_gl_mappings_and_periods.sql` - Enhanced GL accounts, mappings, and periods
7. `sql/16_enhanced_gl_posting_functions.sql` - Enhanced RPC functions for GL posting
8. `sql/17_variance_monitoring_rpc_functions.sql` - RPC functions for variance monitoring
9. `sql/18_notification_tables.sql` - Tables for notifications and preferences

### Documentation
10. `ACCOUNTING_INTEGRATION.md` - Comprehensive documentation for the accounting integration
11. `src/services/accounting/README.md` - Documentation for accounting services

## Files Updated

### Domain Services
1. `src/domain/manufacturing/equivalentUnits.ts` - Enhanced to use posting service and send notifications

### UI Components
2. `src/features/manufacturing/equivalent-units-dashboard.tsx` - Updated to use real backend services instead of mock data

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced GL Foundation
- Proper tenant isolation with RLS
- Accounting periods with open/closed status
- Enhanced chart of accounts for process costing
- Flexible account mappings by event, work center, material, and stage

### 2. Secure Posting Functions
- Idempotency protection to prevent duplicate postings
- Period validation to ensure postings to open periods only
- Journal balance validation to ensure all entries are balanced
- Tenant security with JWT validation

### 3. Variance Monitoring
- Automated variance analysis between standard and actual costs
- Overhead variance analysis by work center
- Scheduled jobs for periodic monitoring
- Variance reporting capabilities

### 4. Notification System
- In-app notifications with read/unread status
- Configurable notification preferences
- Multiple delivery channels (email, SMS, push - placeholder implementations)
- Severity-based filtering

### 5. UI Integration
- Dashboard connected to real backend services
- Real-time variance alerts
- Interactive equivalent units calculation
- Visual charts and reports

## Security Features

1. **Tenant Isolation** - All operations are scoped to the current tenant using RLS
2. **Idempotency** - Prevents duplicate processing with idempotency keys
3. **Period Validation** - Ensures postings are only made to open accounting periods
4. **Balance Validation** - Automatically validates that journal entries are balanced
5. **JWT Validation** - All RPC functions validate tenant access through JWT

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Proper Search Paths** - All RPC functions set search_path to public
2. **Indexing** - Proper indexes on tenant_id and other frequently queried columns
3. **Constraints** - Check constraints on amounts and other critical fields
4. **Audit Trail** - Created/updated timestamps on all tables
5. **Documentation** - Comprehensive documentation for all components

## Testing Scenarios Covered

1. **Scrap Processing** - Convert scrap to finished goods and sell
2. **Regrind Processing** - Convert regrind to new products
3. **External Processing** - Send materials for external processing
4. **Overhead Variance** - Compare applied vs actual overhead
5. **Period Management** - Post to open periods, fail on closed periods
6. **Idempotency** - Prevent duplicate postings

## Integration Points

1. **Process Costing** - Equivalent units calculations feed into variance analysis
2. **Inventory Management** - AVCO inventory movements linked to GL entries
3. **Manufacturing Orders** - MO costs tracked through all stages
4. **Work Centers** - OH applied by work center with flexible mappings
5. **Reporting** - Trial balance, variance reports, and other financial reports

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-currency Support** - Add FX rate handling for multi-currency transactions
2. **Advanced Reporting** - More detailed financial reports and dashboards
3. **Integration with External Systems** - ERP, payroll, and other system integrations
4. **Advanced Notification Channels** - Implement real email, SMS, and push notifications
5. **Machine Learning** - Predictive variance analysis and anomaly detection
